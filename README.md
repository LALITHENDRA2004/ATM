# Java ATM Project

A simple ATM simulation program written in Java. This project models basic ATM functionalities such as checking balance, depositing money, and withdrawing money.

***

## 🚀 Features

- Check current account balance
- Deposit money into the account
- Withdraw money from the account
- Simple and clear object-oriented design with a dedicated `Atm` class to manage the account state

***

## 🛠️ How It Works

- The program uses an `Atm` class to manage private fields: balance, deposit amount, and withdraw amount with getters and setters.
- A main class (`AtmMain`) interacts with the user via the console to perform transactions.
- Users can deposit and withdraw money, and view their balance after each operation.

## 📂 File Structure

```
Atm.java       # Contains the Atm class with balance and transaction methods
AtmMain.java   # Contains the main method and user interaction logic
```
